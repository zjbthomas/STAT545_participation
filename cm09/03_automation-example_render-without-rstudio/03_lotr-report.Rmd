LOTR R Markdown file
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. In this example, its purpose is to allow us to demonstrate how to use `rmarkdown::render()` without the help of RStudio's buttons. We will, in fact, call `rmarkdown::render()` from within a `Makefile`.

```{r include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
lotr_dat <- read.delim("lotr_clean.tsv")
## infer order of Race and Film factors from order in file
lotr_dat <-
  within(lotr_dat, {
    Race <- factor(as.character(Race), levels = unique(Race))
    Film <- factor(as.character(Film), levels = unique(Film))
  })
## WARNING: probably not a safe long-run strategy for communicating factor level
## order with plain text data files; I see no guarantees that unique() return 
## value will be in any particular order; I have just noticed anecdotally that
## return value is in order of appearance
```

Here is a plot we are making "on the fly" via code in an R chunk.
```{r stripplot, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 6}
the_film <- levels(lotr_dat$Film)[2]
p <- ggplot(lotr_dat, aes(x = Race, y = Words)) + scale_y_log10() +
  ggtitle(paste(the_film, "(made from code in R Markdown)")) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/2, position = position_jitter(width = 0.1))
print(p)
```

Here is a pre-made plot we are merely embedding in the compiled document.
