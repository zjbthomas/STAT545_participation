__Note__: This package isn't actually meant to be "serious". I made it just for teaching purposes.

Want to compute powers without having to use `^` or `**`? Give `sqrt` some friends by loading the `powers` package! 

```{r}
library(powers)
```

Want squares, cubes, or reciprocals? Easy.

```{r}
square(1:10)
cube(1:10)
```

`apply`-family friendly, too!

```{r}
my_list <- list(1:10, 0.5, -0.7)
## So base-R-boring!
lapply(my_list, function(x) x^2)
## Use powers instead!
lapply(my_list, square)
```
